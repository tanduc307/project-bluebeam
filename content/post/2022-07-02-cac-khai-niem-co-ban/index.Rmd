# Some basic concepts

• An *experimental unit* refers to the unit of experimental material to which a treatment is applied. Một đơn vị thí nghiệm là thuật ngữ chỉ đến một đơn vị/một cái nào đó đang được thí nghiệm, có thể là một chiếc lá, một cái cây, một khu vực chứa nhiều cây, một cái chậu, một mặt bằng trong nhà lưới, một cá thể động vật, vài cá thể động vật hoặc một quần thể sinh vật nào đó.

• It can be a single leaf, a whole plant, an area of ground containing many plants, a pot or a flat in the green house, a single animal, several animal, or an entire herd [@littleAgriculturalExperimentationDesign1978, pp. 11-13]. 

• The term *plot* is synonymous with experimental unit and is frequently used in referring to plant experimental units. "Plot" is sometimes incorrectly used in referring to an entire experiment that really consists of several plots [@phamxuankieuGiaoTrinhXac2005].

[• A measurable characteristic of an experimental unit is called a *variable*.]{style="color: blue;"}

• A variable can be *discrete* (discontinuous), assuming only specific values, the number of diseased plants per lot for example, or it can be *continuous* and assume any value between certain limits, for example, the yield of grain from a plot of barley.

[• Individual measurements of a variable are called *variates*.]{style="color: red;"}

• A treatment is dosage of material or a method that is to be tested in the experiment. A crop variety is a kind of a treatment. When a treatment is applied to more than one experimental unit we have *replication* of that treatment. Two experimental units treated alike constitute two replications (or replicates). Experimental units receiving different treatments that have been replicated and arranged in a suitable design constitute an *experiment* (or trail or test).

• In a statistical sense, a *population* is a set of measurements or counts of a single variable taken on all the units specified to be in the population. The population may be relatively small, such as the grain production per acre of all the barley fields in a specified area in a specified year, or it may be large, for example, the heights of all men over 20 years of age in the United States or the yields that would result from all possible plots of a [*given*]{style="color: red;"} shape that could be arranged on an experimental area.

• Even a *small* population usually involves a measurement on a very large number of individuals or experimental units. We may have a population of a variable from individual experimental units, a population of means of samples of the variable, or a population of differences between pairs of sample means.

• A *sample* is a set of measurements that constitutes part of a population. We obtain information and make inferences about a population from a sample. For this reason, it is important that the sample be representative of the population. To obtain a representative sample, we use the principle of randomness. A *random sample* is one in which any individual measurement is as likely to be included as any other.

: A frequency table. Refractometer readings of 10000 onion bulbs.

• Populations are described by characteristics called *parameters*. Parameters are fixed values. For example, the arithmetic mean of all the variates in a population is a parameter. It has only one value, although we seldom know what it is.

• Samples are described by the same characteristics, but when applied to samples they are called *statistics*. The mean of a sample is a statistic. We calculate statistics from samples to estimate population parameters. Statistics vary from sample to sample.

• Different values of a variable have different *frequencies* of occurrence in the population. To conveniently describe (characterize) a population, data from a large sample are commonly organized by the construction of a *frequency table*, a *frequency histogram*, and a *frequency polygon*. In a frequency table above, variates are tallied as to the several class intervals in which they fall...

# The normal distribution

The imposing formula for describing a normal frequency curve is

$$f = \frac{N}{{(\sigma \sqrt {2\pi } )}}{e^{ - {{(y - \mu )}^2}/2{\sigma ^2}}}$$
